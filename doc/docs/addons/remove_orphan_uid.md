# Remove Orphan UID

Removes orphan UIDs from the project. Orphan UIDs can happen if you delete files outside the editor and do not remove the related uid file.

Use `Project` -> `Tools` -> `Remove Orphan UID` to remove.

!!! note

    UIDs are only generated since Godot 4.4.

!!! note "Credits"

    You are not required to credit this plugin in your in-app credits, as it is only used within the editor and not in the final product. However, you may do so if you wish.
