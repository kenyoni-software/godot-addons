> When you import a plugin or open a Godot project for the first time, you may encounter errors due to plugin behavior. This occurs because most plugins rely on preload functionality, which cannot load assets during the initial import. To resolve this issue and ensure proper functionality, simply reload the project. Once reloaded, the errors will disappear.
